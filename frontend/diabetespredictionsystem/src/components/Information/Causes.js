                    The exact cause of diabetes varies depending on the type. Type 1 diabetes is believed to result from genetic and environmental factors triggering an autoimmune response.
                    Type 2 diabetes is often associated with obesity, physical inactivity, genetics, and lifestyle factors such as unhealthy diet and smoking.
                    Gestational diabetes occurs due to hormonal changes during pregnancy and may increase the risk of developing type 2 diabetes later in life.
