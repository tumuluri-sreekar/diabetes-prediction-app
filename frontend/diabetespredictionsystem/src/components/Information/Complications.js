                    Diabetes can lead to various complications if not properly managed. These complications may include cardiovascular disease, neuropathy (nerve damage), retinopathy (eye damage), nephropathy (kidney damage), and foot problems.
                    It's crucial for individuals with diabetes to monitor their blood sugar levels regularly and follow a comprehensive treatment plan to prevent or delay the onset of complications.
