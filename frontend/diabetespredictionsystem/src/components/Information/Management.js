                    Diabetes management involves a combination of diet, exercise, medication, and lifestyle changes. A balanced diet rich in fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and lean proteins can help control blood sugar levels.
                    Regular physical activity is essential for improving insulin sensitivity and maintaining overall health.
                    Medications such as insulin, oral glucose-lowering drugs, and other injectable therapies may be prescribed to manage blood sugar levels effectively.
                    Lifestyle modifications, such as quitting smoking, reducing stress, and getting adequate sleep, can also contribute to diabetes management.
