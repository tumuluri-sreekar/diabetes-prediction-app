                    Diabetes is classified into several types, including type 1, type 2, gestational diabetes, and others.
                    Type 1 diabetes is an autoimmune condition where the body's immune system attacks insulin-producing cells in the pancreas.
                    Type 2 diabetes is characterized by insulin resistance and relative insulin deficiency.
                    Gestational diabetes occurs during pregnancy and usually resolves after childbirth.
                    Other types of diabetes may result from specific genetic mutations, diseases, or medications.
